                    You could be a tie fighter pilot, strom trooper, gunnery specialist, bomb defusal technician, or even cyber warfare. The options vary in speciality and degree. One could use the skills learned to persue great career choices outside of service,
                    skills that are needed in civilian life. If you should choose to retire from the military, there are great benifits that come. There will be a stipent that will be payed to you and your family monthly. Housing will be provided, and we will make
                    sure that you live in comfort for the rest of your lives. If you are wounded, we will take care of all medical and rehab charges, and if you do perish, your family will be takin care of.
