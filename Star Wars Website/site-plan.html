      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Are you tired of this war between the Imperials and the terrorist rebel scum?
          What can you do to help your great Emperor bring peace and prosperity to galaxy?
          This website will bring enough information and recourses needed to start your great journey with the great Imperial Army.
          I will highlight key job opportunities needed, and what requirements are necessary to join.
          I will also highlight the grand benefits that come with service, and what you can do with the skills you learn after service.
          I have made many recruitment websites, as I am an Imperial Engineer and have worked on many projects.]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[The intended audience for this website is young adults from a wide variety of races across the galaxy.
          Fit and able body individuals who want to make a difference and who want to feel like they are a part of a team.
          18–30 year old’s, who maybe have no other options, or feel a since of duty to the Empire, or who have been hurt/wronged by the Republic.
          It will also educate the older citizens of the Empire that we mean business when we are recruiting and that we are professional and highly capable of producing a top tier army to protect them.]</p>  <!-- change this -->
