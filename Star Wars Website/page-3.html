                <p class="p-2-msg-1">Each different occupations has differing pay and benifits. As stated before, the base payrate for the enlisted troopers is 50,000 credits a year, with a 5,000 pay raise every year. This is affected by
                    status, trainings, and other battlefield encouters. Officers start their payrate at 80,000 a year, and gain a 5,000 dollar payrise every year. Benifits are as follows. Discounts for all your family when buying from the Empire.
                    You and your family will be given all the necessities of life, per your station as a trooper or officer. Full coverage on everything, medical, educational, health, etc. In the event of your death in the service of the Empire,
                    your family will still reiceve a payment monthly, not as much as your paycheck, but it will keep them well taken care of.

                </p>
                <p class="p-2-msg-2">The standard length of service for a stromtrooper is 5 years. One may extend that if they wish to create a career out of the military. Once the 5 years are up, you may choose to become a civilian, but the military
                    will no longer give you the benifits of being a service member, and you are on your own. To recieve benifits for life, you must stay in the military for 20 years. In the galaxy, there are many threats that need to be silenced.
                    The array of planets that the Empire must bring peace to is vast, so you will be able to travel the endless seas of space at no cost to yourself. A usual deployment lasts anywhere from 6 months to 1 year, the you get to come home
                    and spend time with your family for 3 months. Officers get to generally choose when they get time off, but that is only if they are in the higher ranks of their unit.

                <p class="rd-msg-1">If you do not wish to travel the stars, there is always the reserve forces that your current planet needs. You get partial benifits, but you get to stay at home and work on your own planet to bring peace to your own little
                    corner of the galexy. This may be an option for our older recruits, or even for some of our veterans who wish to still fight, but are too worn out to travel long distances. Also, for our younger recruits under the age of 17, there are
                    many differnt acadamys that train you to become officers and troopers. The most notable is the one on Coruscant, who produces the finest and most deadly elite troopers in the galaxy.
