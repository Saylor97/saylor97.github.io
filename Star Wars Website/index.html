                <p>The Galactic Empire is only as strong as its valeant troopers who wish to elist. The minimum requirements are that you are between the ages of 17-34, know basic, have at least a basic education, and are a citizen of the Empire.
                    Also, there is a written and physical test one must pass in order to be considered for service. We are looking for individuals who wish to fight against the insurgant rebal forces who hurt the people of this great Empire.
                    Those who do pass this very light requirement process will see many different worlds, meet many different species, gain many valuable skills that will also benefit you after your term of service. And, if you choose to make
                    a career out of being in the military, there are benifits and opportunities that await you.
                </p>
                <p>There is a signing bonus of 20,000 credits for those who wish to join. It should not be about the money you will recieve, but we will take care of you while you are fighting for our Emperor.
                    Your families will also be taken care of, and given many discounts for having family in the service. You will find that, even though you may be far from home, your family will never be too far off.
                </p>

                <p>There will be more indepth answers to quesitons on the next two pages, but this is the basic information that will get you into started.
                    1. The training takes 4 cycles.
                    2. You will be given credentials that allow you to fly from any major spaceport once training is complete (usually with special benefits depending on the space service).
                    3. You will be given full coverage under the Empries Military Act, and so will your family.
                    4. You will serve for your full time.
                    5. Every trooper starts out earning 50,000 credits.
                    6. In the event of an accident, your family will be taken care of.
